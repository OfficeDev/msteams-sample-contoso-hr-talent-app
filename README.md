# Microsoft Teams Talent Management Sample App in .NET/C#

This app simulates connection to a recruiting and talent management system and allows users and teams to create, manage and search positions and candidates. The content is randomly generated to simulate what you can do with Teams. The full source code is provided, along with a lab guide that will walk you through the setup of this app, and how to surface it in Teams.

This is a sample of the HR solution, please do not use it in a Production environment. It is designed to demonstrate how third-party apps can be surfaced in teams using the various interfaces that exist within Teams as a Platform.

## How to use this lab
Open the [Teams Apps Talent Management Lab.pdf](/Teams%20Apps%20Talent%20Mangagement%20Lab.pdf) document, and start working through the guidance in this document. This guide will walk you through, step-by-step with screenshots, the setup of the app (in Visual Studio, using NGROK as the tunnel) and the setup of the Teams app, which will introduce you to how the various interfaces in Teams work when surfacing a third-party app within Teams (Tabs, Bots, Messaging Extensions, Azure AD SSO, Proactive Messaging & Graph API).
